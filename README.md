# WinterFAFathon 2016
During Winter FAFathon 2016 there was created a game called *HackLabs*, which aims to reproduce the process of copying the lab work during the exams.

Runs on localhost:8000. 

Arrows for movement, spacebar for copying near the friend. Nearby the teacher the amount of copied work dramatically decreases. If it decreases to 0 (zero), the game ends.

Created within 24 hours.
